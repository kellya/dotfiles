My Dotfiles
-----------

Here are my configuration files that I use on my system.  I use Vundle (https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) for all of my plugin management, so in order to get most of the things working, you need to have that installed first.


File Naming
+++++++++++
You should clone this to your home directory, and then create a symlink for the files.  For example, if you want to use my .vimrc, you would:

#. cd ~
#. ln -s ~dotfiles/vim/vimrc .vimrc

At some point I may make a utility to manage those, but that's the way to do it for now
